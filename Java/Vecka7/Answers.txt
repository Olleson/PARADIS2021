Q1) Which of the two programs, Program1 and Program2, has best performance, or are the performance of the two programs about the same?
My Program1 is slightly faster than Program2.  

Program1 times:
1.0445588
1.0520333
1.0386494
1.0514962
1.0302688
1.0775461
1.0624651
1.0548731
1.0429395
1.0288106

Program2 times:
1.3047406
1.3138838
1.3479334
1.2995248
1.3249264
1.2971561
1.3203017
1.3189043
1.3225967
1.3232275

Q2) Is there any difference in which order different work tasks are performed in the two different solutions, Program1 and Program2?

There is a difference, yes.

Program1 triggers all of the downloads, then all of the analysis, then all of the categorisations (no guarantee that each will be completed before triggering the next stage).
However, nothing will be analysed until there are pages to analyze (which comes from downloading). So each stage functions as a consumer by sitting and blocking to 
consume while also producing work for the next stage (analysis or categorisation).
e.g.
    block while waiting for task in queue
    consume task by downloading/analysing/categorizing
    add this web page for the next queue

Program2 doesn't "trigger" in the same way as Program1. It instead goes through each Web Page in the list and does the following:
    download
    analysed
    categorize
for each page. It's tied down by the fact that it has to go through each webpage one stage at a time despite being done on multiple threads at the same time.
